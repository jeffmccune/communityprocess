# Why more Tooling?

Too many sources of information are tedious and error prone to review.

 * Issue Tracker (Should I work on this *now*?)
 * Jenkins and Travis (Does this patch break stuff?)
 * Github (What are people saying about this patch?)
 * CLA (Has the contributor signed the license agreement?)
 * Trello (What should we be working on?)

All of this information is important.  It's also spread out on *four* or mire
different sites.  It was often overlooked.

A solution is to move all of the information into *one place*.
