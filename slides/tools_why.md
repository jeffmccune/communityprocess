# Why more Tooling

Too many sources of information are tedious and error prone to review.

 * Issue Tracker
   * Should I work on this *now*?
 * Jenkins and Travis
   * Does this patch break stuff?
 * Github
   * What are people saying about this patch?
 * Trello
   * What should be worked on?

All of this information is important.  It's also spread out on *four* or mire
different sites.  It was often overlooked.
